# Ordinal Markup
get to work lazy *cough cough* PATCAIL


A game of maximizing ordinals and decreasing numbers

FILE OVERVIEW:<br>
`calc.js` will contain all of the get() and calc() functions that get the value of something.<br>
`saveload.js` will contain initiation, saving, and loading files.<br>
`color.js` will contain functions relating to the conversion of colors and the color of the ordinal.<br>
`script.js` will contain all other stuff.

Add more.

## OM: Easier
this mod games ordinal markup easier. list buffed:
* factor shifts now cheaper:<br><br>
1st: `200` -> `100`<br>
2nd: `1000` -> `500`<br>
3rd: `10000` -> `2500`<br>
4th: `350000` -> `150000`<br>
5th: `1e12` -> `1e10`<br>
6th: `1e21` -> `1e20`<br>
7th: without changes<br>
